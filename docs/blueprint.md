## Core Features:

- Digital Cart & Order Submission: Sales personnel can create digital carts by scanning products, view in-store quantity, adjust prices, and submit orders.
- Order Preparation & Notification: Storekeepers scan products to prepare orders, triggering notifications to sales personnel when ready for the cashier.
- Payment Processing & Invoice Generation: Cashiers retrieve order details using the invoice number, apply discounts and taxes, process payments (cash, card, or split), and print invoice slips. Inventory is automatically updated upon payment.
- Admin Panel: Administrators manage products, prices, expiry dates, returns, view/modify orders, generate user accounts, and manage user roles.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a clean, professional blue (#29ABE2) for the main interface.
- Secondary color: A light grey (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds and content separation.
- Accent: A vibrant green (#90EE90) to indicate successful actions, like payment confirmation or order completion.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for all text elements.
- Use consistent and clear icons for navigation and actions, following a minimalist style.
- Maintain a clear and structured layout with logical grouping of information for each user role (salesperson, storekeeper, cashier, admin).
