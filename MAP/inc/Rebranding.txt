The file you need to modify is:

src/config/branding.ts

How to modify it:

Open the src/config/branding.ts file in your code editor. You will see an object called brandingConfig. It looks like this:

// src/config/branding.ts

interface BrandingConfig {
  appName: string;
  companyNameForInvoice: string;
  companyAddressForInvoice: string;
  companyPhoneForInvoice: string;
  companyWebsiteForInvoice?: string;
  logoPath: string; // Relative to /public directory
  faviconPath: string; // Relative to /public directory
}

export const brandingConfig: BrandingConfig = {
  appName: "Retail Genie", // <-- CHANGE THIS for app name
  companyNameForInvoice: "Retail Genie Solutions", // <-- CHANGE THIS for invoice
  companyAddressForInvoice: "Muscat, Oman", // <-- CHANGE THIS for invoice
  companyPhoneForInvoice: "+968-94700685", // <-- CHANGE THIS for invoice
  companyWebsiteForInvoice: "www.retailgenie.example", // <-- CHANGE THIS (optional)
  logoPath: "/assets/logo.svg", // <-- CHANGE THIS to your logo file path
  faviconPath: "/assets/favicon.svg", // <-- CHANGE THIS to your favicon file path
};
To change the details for a new vendor:

Edit the values for the properties inside the brandingConfig object. For example:

To change the app name: appName: "New Vendor App Name",
To change the company name on the invoice: companyNameForInvoice: "New Vendor Company Inc.",
To change the phone number on the invoice: companyPhoneForInvoice: "+1-555-123-4567",
To change the logo: logoPath: "/new_vendor_assets/new_logo.png",
To change the favicon: faviconPath: "/new_vendor_assets/new_favicon.ico",
Place your logo and favicon files:

Make sure the actual image files (e.g., new_logo.png, new_favicon.ico) exist in your public directory at the paths you specified in logoPath and faviconPath. For instance, if logoPath is /new_vendor_assets/new_logo.png, you should create a folder named new_vendor_assets inside your public folder and place new_logo.png there.
Remember that EPS files are not directly web-compatible. You'll need to convert your logo to SVG (recommended) or PNG for the main app logo, and to SVG, ICO, or PNG for the favicon.
Restart your application:

If you're running the development server (npm run dev), stop it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C) and restart it.
If you're running a production build, you'll need to rebuild (npm run build) and restart your server (npm run start).
